Google Summer of Code Scala Numerical PDE solver

As the title says, this is my GSoC summer project which consists of writing software to numerically solve PDEs and calculate error on the solutions. 

The first part consists of the finite difference method which given a boundary condition we assume that nearby points can be computed by assuming that they are close in value to points in proximity.
